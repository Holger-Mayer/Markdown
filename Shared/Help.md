This is a simple Markdown editor. 

On the left side is your editor pane, on the right side is a rendered preview of your markdown text.

Tap into the left pane and enter your text. The preview pane immediatly displays the rendered text.

You can enter  markdown template texts with the buttons in the top bar.

If you selected a piece of text it will be replaced by the markdown template.
